# vgc_team_calcs
 
Python script to perform bulk damage calcs for Pokemon, specifically SwSh VGC.

User Options:
dynamax = True - Not current working
only_strongest_moves = False - Only use strongest moves
only_first_set = False - Only use the most popular set
mew_mode = False - Used for calcing against Mew (a base 600 Pokemon, with 100 in all stats), this option negates type effectiveness
